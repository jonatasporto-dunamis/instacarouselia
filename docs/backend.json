    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage Instagram carousels generated by AI, focusing on user-owned data. Each user can create and manage their carousels and slides. Authorization Independence is achieved by storing carousels and slides as subcollections under each user's document (`/users/{userId}/carousels/{carouselId}` and `/users/{userId}/carousels/{carouselId}/slides/{slideId}`), granting the user full ownership and control without needing to check any other document. Path-based ownership provides strong security and avoids authorization dependencies on other documents. Slides are stored as a subcollection of carousels to maintain a clear hierarchical structure and enforce ownership. This also enables efficient querying for a user's carousels and their associated slides. This structure supports the application's QAPs because listing carousels or slides is always scoped to a specific user, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data. The `slideIds` array in the Carousel entity helps in maintaining the order of slides and can be used for efficient retrieval of slides for a given carousel."
