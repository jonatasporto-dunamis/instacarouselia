## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A020F0) to convey creativity and innovation.
- Background color: Desaturated light purple (#E6D0FF). A light background will let the saturated primary and accent color stand out.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FFA500) as a complementary color to purple, adding energy and excitement.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a contemporary and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif known for readability, particularly on digital screens. Inter is suitable for both headlines and body text; this is only a suggestion if longer text is present in the generated carousel slides.
- Use modern and sleek icons to represent various functions, such as editing, exporting, and saving.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on visual hierarchy to guide users through the creation process.
